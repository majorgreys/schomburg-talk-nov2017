## Jim Crow on a Hill

- **Good evening**
- My talk tonight concerns the City College of New York and it's place within
  a segregated New York City.
- Before I begin, I want to thank Jeanne and Komozi for inviting me to speak
  on this history. I also want to thank them for being generous mentors over
the past three years. It was their summer research institute two summers ago
where I first began to piece together the history that I will be presenting
on tonight.
- I will begin with a moment in this history which captures the central
  contradiction between the image of City College as the "Harvard of the
Poor" and the reality of it as *a predominatly white and public college*
located atop hill overlooking the overwhelmingly black residents of Harlem. 
- Meritocracy and testing in New York was the mechanism that effectively
  produced racial inequality.
- Free for the most deserving. Already rationed.

## Focus on segregation, anywhere but at home | Martin Luther King Jr. and President Buell Gallagher at City College commencement in 1963

<div class="notes">
- Talk about the photo, use it as a springboard more for this moment in time.  King is not as well known. Gallagher's self-satisfied smile.
- On June 12, 1963, an estimated 15,000 people gathered in the stadium of
  City College of New York for its 117th commencement. Days before the event,
the *New York Times* had noted that the graduating class would be the largest
it had been since 1950. This commencement was also significant because
Reverend Martin Luther King Jr had been invited to deliver the address to the
graduates.
- For an institution with as long commitment to educational opportunity as
  City College, the focus that day was understandably on the Southern Civil
Rights movement. King spoke at City College at a critical juncture in the
Southern Civil Rights movement he had come to be identified with as a leading
figure. The invitation to speak had come in early May with the dramatic
events in Birmingham, Alabama. There a campaign of economic boycotts and
direct action dramatized, for the nation, the obstinacy of Southern
segregationists. When the city police met a march of school children with
attack dogs and fire hoses, the photographs printed in national newspapers
disturbed many across the nation and, finally, pushed the White House to
intervene.  After another week of escalating direct action and with city
jails full, businessmen finally reached an agreement on the desegregation
demands of the movement.
- At commencement, King was addressing New Yorkers who had likely been
  disturbed by the events in Birmingham. The previous evening, President John
F. Kennedy had delivered a speech on live television to introduce federal
legislation to further the cause of civil rights. Indeed, Kennedy had began
the speech by foregrounding federal desegregation efforts at the University
of Alabama. 
- On the morning of commencement day, Medgar Evers, the NAACP field secretary
  in Mississippi, was murdered. 
- Calling the murder a "dastardly act," King captured the turbulunce of the
  moment: "Just as the sunlight of reason stemmed into American homes and the
wisdom and courage of a President were eloquently expressed in an appeal for
justice and human dignity, the most sullen cloud which has appeared on our
national horizon has darkened our sky."
- City College President Buell Gallagher also denounced the murder and called
  upon those gathered to support federal legislation called for by President
Kennedy. Gallagher understood the dynamics of the Jim Crow system. Before
City College, Gallagher, a white man from New Jersey, had been the president
of Talledega College, a historically black private college in Alabama. His
book, *American Caste and the Negro College* published in 1938, had won
praise from W. E. B. Du Bois.  In 1943, Gallagher was elected to the board of
directors of the NAACP, a position he would resign from nearly 30 years
later.

## A liberalism that was truly liberal

![](assets/images/king-speech-1963.jpg)

<div class="notes">

- Though the attention of those gathered at City College was directed South,
  the telling absence of Black graduates highlights the Northern liberal
contours of Jim Crow as a national problem. According to one estimate, less
tharound 35 black graduates of the 3500 graduates that day received bachelor
degrees. While the *Times* focused on graduation records, it failed to
mention how the number of Black graduates had too not changed over the
intervening fifteen years. 
- Certainly for King, as he looked out on the few black faces seated up
  front, racial injustice was not a problem unique to the South. Three years
earlier, King had remarked "there is a pressing need for a liberalism in the
North which is truly liberal, a liberalism that firmly believes in
integration in its own community as well as in the deep South." Indeed, in
his speech to City College graduates, King called upon them to "see that the
de facto segregation of the north is as injurious to the Negro student as the
legal segregation of the south." 
- The image of King in traditional academic regalia foreshadows his words two
  years later, after a summer of urban rebellions, when he admonished
Northern liberals with whom he had "sat on platforms with all the imposing
regalia of office," showering Southern blacks with praise of heroism, yet
"when the issues were joined concerning local condition only the language was
polite; the rejection was firm and unequivocal." 
- The liberalism on display at the City College commencement was one that
  embraced the national civil rights struggle even as it could show little
progress for racial justice within its own walls. The college welcomed a
leader of the Southern struggle even as it applauded a predominantly white
graduating class in a city with close to a million black residents.
- I believe the absence of black students at City College in the 1960s helps
  us understand an important, though still hidden, history of Jim Crow in New
York.
- Addressing the racial problem at City College was not as simple as removing
  a George Wallace from its gates. University administrators were immunized
from charges of racial discrimination because they could always point to the
unbiased, color-blind meritocratic admissions requirements. Students were
admitted solely based on their high school grade averages and standardized
test scores. Their applications had no mention of race, ethnicity, nor
religious affiliation. Being blind to the race of the student, this
meritocracy obscured the unequal and segregated system of public education in
the city which City College was part of.  
- Instead of redressing City College's racial problem, policy makers doubled
  down on the meritocratic ideals that created the disparities. In the early
1960s, a city commission reviewing the municipal college system reported how
the shifting demographics of the public schools meant fewer high school
graduates would satisfy the admission requirements at the municipal colleges.
But it warned that "lower admission requirements will substantially increase
the number of students who will have to vie for seats in already crowded
classrooms." Instead, the commission recommended keeping admission
requirements highly selective at the top-tier of the system, the
tuition-free, four-year senior colleges, while leaning on less selective, but
tuition-charging evening session and the two-year community colleges. This
structure, which would remain in place till the end of the decade, penalized
the city's Black students twice: High admission requirements for the
tuition-free senior colleges meant the poor, who were disproportionately
Black, were excluded from the benefits of a "universal" social provision;
Those few that did enroll, did so as tuition-paying non-matriculants, thus
disproportionately bearing the burden of financing the expansion of the very
"universal" social provision from which they were being excluded.
- The persistence of a racial problem at City College is the backdrop to the
  Open Admissions struggle in 1969, where Black and Puerto Rican students
take direct action across the CUNY campuses, percipitating a political crisis
that finally lowers the admissions requirements. Over 70,000 additional
students enroll in the college in the fall of 1970, doubling CUNY enrollments
in a matter of years.

## Bitterly ironic | Comparing City College to Jim Crow South

<div class="notes">
- In a report to a special State legislative committee, Lester Granger, the former director of the Urban League, concluded that the evidence of racial disparities in the municipal colleges revealed a "bitterly ironic" comparison between local conditions to Jim Crow South. 
- Though the Black population of New York City was approximately the same as it was in all of Louisiana, Granger found that the senior colleges of the municipal system enrolled only 1,000 Black students whereas Louisiana's state colleges enrolled more than 10,000. City College was no good for "a racial group or one of its members against whom college entrance doors are barred."

## Egalitarian in a segregated system | "Harvard of the Poor" in segregated New York City

(Add statistics on segregation)

<div class="notes">

- The doors to the tuition-free municipal colleges remained closed to Black
  students educated in a segregated public education system. Of the two types
of public high schools--academic and vocational--only students attending
academic high schools could graduate with the necessary requirements to be
admitted to City College. In 1967, only 3.7 percent of the academic diplomas
went to Black high school graduates.
- Given the realities of segregated public education, Granger proposed
  admissions be based on student rankings within their high school, rather
than in competition with all of the city's high school graduates. Granger
called for leveling the playing field for students educated in an unequal,
segregated public education system.
- One of the most vocal and political influential advocates of the college's
  high admission requirements was the Alumni Association. In its statement
following the Granger report, it effectively called the proposal racist since
it implies that Black and Puerto Rican students are incapable of competing on
an equal level with their white counterparts. In fact, for City College
students and alumni, the century-old free tuition policy was a tuition-free
scholarship for the most deserving. It was not "a matter of charity" for
them.
