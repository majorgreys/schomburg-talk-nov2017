. . . 

> Many of them sat on platforms with all the imposing regalia of office to
> welcome me to their cities, and showered praise on the heroism of Southern
> Negroes. Yet when the issues were joined concerning local conditions only the
> language was polite; the rejection was firm and unequivocal. (MLK, 1965)

City College President Buell Gallagher was a prototypical Northern liberal

# Meritocratic immunity of racial liberalism

![Offices of the Board of Higher Education](assets/images/bhe.jpg)

> - Meritocratic ideals immunized CUNY to charges of racial discrimination
> - Keep admission requirements higher for the few tuition-free seats in the day session
> - Add tuition-charging seats in the less selective evening sessions and community
colleges
> - Black students only 3.6 percent of total tuition-free enrollment
> - 60 percent of Black students enrolled as tuition-paying
> - A double penalty: excluded *and* subsidizing free tuition for others

# Enduring legacy of racial liberalism

![Students at anti-tuition rally, 1976](assets/images/ccny-protest-1976.jpg)

> - CUNY doubled down in the 1960s on the meritocratic ideals that had created racial disparities
> - Earlier reform efforts reveal how the ideal of liberal meritocracy was a barrier to racial justice
> - Hunter student: "That City College is situated in a Negro area does not entitle Negroes to admission any more than the location of Cooper Union in the Bowery entitles derelicts to admission"
> - "New York City's education is infinitely better... but of what good is a superior education to a racial group or one of its members against whom college entrance doors are barred."
> - It was "criminal that a college so close, a college originally designed for poor people, has not opened its doors to them"
> - Students renamed the "Harvard of the Poor" as "The University of Harlem"
