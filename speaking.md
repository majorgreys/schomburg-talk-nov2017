- Good evening! Before I begin, I want to thank Jeanne Theoharis and
  Komozi Woodard for inviting me to tonight's conversation. They have been
  generous mentors to me over the past three years. <!-- It was at their
  summer research institute two years ago where I first began to think
  about my research as part of the history of the black freedom struggle.
  -->
- The topic of my talk tonight is racial inequality at the City University
  of New York in the 1960s. My focus will be on City College of New York,
  only a short walk from the Schomburg Library where we are gathered
  tonight. 
- Many New Yorkers might know City College as the "Harvard of the Poor."
  Unlike the elitist and aristocratic Harvard, City College was associated
  with egalitarian and democratic ideals where the city's poor were
  educated tuition-free until the policy was terminated following the
  city's fiscal crisis in 1976. 
- But there is another side of "Harvard of the Poor" image, one which is
  often neglected but is as crucial to understanding its history, is that
  admissions at City College was as selective as it was at a place like
  Harvard or Columbia. Put simply: If you did not qualify for admissions
  based on your high school grades, then you did not deserve
  a tax-supported tuition-free scholarship. By the 1960s, the egalitarian
  and democratic mission of City College was more myth than reality.
  During an era of sharpening racial conflict, particularly around
  education inequalities, the meritocratic tradition of City College was
  used by policy makers and advocates of the status quo to justify why the
  college could remain predominatly white. 
<!--
- TODO: Public institution that takes on merit, think of a public hospital
  doing the same, unique among social democratic core (see Tyranny of
  meritocracy) Meritocracy: objective measurement of demonstrated ability
  and effort, those that succeed deserve to; assumes level playing field
  Who deserves to be at City College -->

# Equality of Opportunity

- City College of New York is 170 years old today. It's predecessor, the
  Free Academy, was created in 1847 by a public referendum where 85
  percent of the city's voters supported the creation of a tax-supported
  public academy. The Free Academy, as the name implies, was by law
  tuition-free: "for the purpose of **extending the benefits of education
  gratuitously** to persons who have been pupils in the common schools."
- The President of the Board of Education, who had proposed the Free
  Academy, had famously declared "**Open the doors to all**--let the
  children of the rich and the poor take their seats together, and **know
  of no distinction save that of industry, good conduct, and intellect**."
  In effect, City College was founded with the mission of equal
  opportunity but only for those with the merits.

## More Myth than Mission

![](assets/images/boroff-1965.jpg)\


- The nickname "Harvard of the Poor" has been long associated with City
  College. It originates from changes that took place in the college
  during the 1920s-1930s. In 1924, a required high school average was
  introduced for gaining admission to city college. This was necessary
  because the number of students qualified for admission and seeking
  higher education had increased. Especially for the children of Jewish
  immigrants arriving at the turn of the century, City College's
  meritocratic admission policies opened opportunity otherwise closed off
  by the discriminatory practices of employers and private colleges.
- Though public higher education in New York City began as tuition-free,
  there was never adequate tax money to provide enough of it. Increasing
  grade requirements at City College effectively **rationed free higher
  education.** As admission requirements continued to climb, the rationing
  that had originally been an unfortunate necessity because of opposition
  to increased taxation, became a virtue of the college, effectively
  transforming it from a universal public good into tuition-free
  scholarships for a most deserving. 
- By the 1960s, the city's municipal colleges were no longer for the
  city's poor. In 1965, David Boroff, a graduate of Brooklyn College,
  wrote in a special feature on City College for the New York Times where
  he observed that "the students themselves have unquestionably changed"
  because they were "**no longer the children of pants pressers and
  pushcart peddlers**." Instead, the students at City College were viewed
  as an "academically elite" able to pay tuition. Admission requirements
  had hit record levels as the children of the postwar baby boom
  graduated. One of the victims of rising admission requirements were the
  city's Black population who were more than ever trapped in inferior
  segregated schooling. As nearly a million white residents left New York
  City, as an equal number of black Southeners and Puerto Ricans moved
  into the city looking for jobs and educational opportunity. Yet,
  throughout the 1960s, while these two groups accounted for half of the
  city's public school population, they accounted for less than 5 percent
  of the tuition-free students at City College. 

## A liberalism that was truly liberal

![](assets/images/king-speech-1963.jpg)\


- It is against this backdrop that I want to talk about the speech that
  Martin Luther King Jr. gave at **City College on June 12, 1963**. An
  estimated 15,000 people were gathered that day at City College for
  commencement. The focus of King's speech was understandably on the
  a **critical juncture in the Southern movement**. He had received the
  invitation to speak in early May during the Birmingham campaign. When
  Birmingham police met a march of school children with attack dogs and
  fire hoses, the photographs printed in national newspapers had shown
  disturbed many across the nation and, finally, pushed the White House to
  intervene. After another week of escalating direct action and with city
  jails full, local businessmen finally reached an agreement on
  desegregation. The night before commencement, President John F. Kennedy
  had delivered a speech on live television to introduce federal
  legislation to further the cause of civil rights. Indeed, Kennedy had
  began the speech by threats of violence following desegregation efforts
  at the University of Alabama. And, tragically, on the morning of
  commencement day, Medgar Evers, the NAACP field secretary in
  Mississippi, was murdered in Mississippi. 
- In his speech to City College graduates that day, King captured the
  turbulence of the moment, where the "sunlight of reason" expressed in
  Kennedy's speech were darkened by the "sullen cloud" of the murder of
  a leading civil rights activist.

## A liberalism in the North which is truly liberal

![](assets/images/king-gallagher-1963.jpg)

- Certainly for King, racial injustice was not a problem unique to the
  South. Three years earlier, King had remarked to an audience in New York
  that "there is a pressing need for **a liberalism in the North which is
  truly liberal**, a liberalism that firmly believes in integration in its
  own community as well as in the deep South." At the 1963 commencement,
  King called upon the graduates to "see that the **de facto segregation
  of the north is as injurious to the Negro student as the legal
  segregation of the south**." 
- Whereas the attention of those gathered at City College was directed
  South, the absence of Black graduates at commencement tells us much
  about Northern liberal version of Jim Crow. If you go through the
  yearbook, you'll find less than 36 black graduates among the 2800
  bachelor degrees, or less than 2 percent. Though the *New York Times*
  noted the number of graduates was the highest it had been since 1950, it
  failed to mention how the number of Black graduates had not changed over
  the intervening fifteen years. 
- The City College President Buell Gallagher, pictured here at King's
  side, also denounced at commencement the murder of Medger Evers and
  called upon those gathered to support Kennedy's proposed federal
  legislation. Gallagher understood well the dynamics of the Jim Crow
  system. Before City College, Gallagher, a white man from New Jersey, had
  been the president of Talledega College, a historically black private
  college in Alabama. His book, *American Caste and the Negro College*
  published in 1938, had won praise from W. E. B. Du Bois. In 1943,
  Gallagher was elected to the board of directors of the NAACP, a position
  he would resign from nearly 30 years later.
- Talk about the photo, use it as a springboard more for this moment in
  time. King is not as well known. Gallagher's self-satisfied smile.
- The image of King in traditional academic regalia foreshadows his words
  two years later, after a summer of urban rebellions, when he admonished
  Northern liberals with whom he had "sat on platforms with all the
  imposing regalia of office," showering Southern blacks with praise of
  heroism, yet "when the issues were joined concerning local condition
  only the language was polite; the rejection was firm and unequivocal." 
- The liberalism on display at the City College commencement was one that
  embraced the national civil rights struggle even as it could show little
  progress for racial justice within its own walls. The college welcomed
  a leader of the Southern struggle even as it applauded a predominantly
  white graduating class in a city with close to a million black
  residents.
- I believe the absence of black students at City College in the 1960s
  helps us understand an important, though still hidden, history of Jim
  Crow in New York.
- Addressing the racial problem at City College was not as simple as
  removing a George Wallace from its gates. University administrators were
  immunized from charges of racial discrimination because they could
  always point to the unbiased, color-blind meritocratic admissions
  requirements. Students were admitted solely based on their high school
  grade averages and standardized test scores. Their applications had no
  mention of race, ethnicity, nor religious affiliation. Being blind to
  the race of the student, this meritocracy obscured the unequal and
  segregated system of public education in the city which City College was
  part of.  
- Instead of redressing City College's racial problem, policy makers
  doubled down on the meritocratic ideals that created the disparities. In
  the early 1960s, a city commission reviewing the municipal college
  system reported how the shifting demographics of the public schools
  meant fewer high school graduates would satisfy the admission
  requirements at the municipal colleges. But it warned that "lower
  admission requirements will substantially increase the number of
  students who will have to vie for seats in already crowded classrooms."
  Instead, the commission recommended keeping admission requirements
  highly selective at the top-tier of the system, the tuition-free,
  four-year senior colleges, while leaning on less selective, but
  tuition-charging evening session and the two-year community colleges.
  This structure, which would remain in place till the end of the decade,
  penalized the city's Black students twice: High admission requirements
  for the tuition-free senior colleges meant the poor, who were
  disproportionately Black, were excluded from the benefits of
  a "universal" social provision; Those few that did enroll, did so as
  tuition-paying non-matriculants, thus disproportionately bearing the
  burden of financing the expansion of the very "universal" social
  provision from which they were being excluded.
- The persistence of a racial problem at City College is the backdrop to
  the Open Admissions struggle in 1969, where Black and Puerto Rican
  students take direct action across the CUNY campuses, percipitating
  a political crisis that finally lowers the admissions requirements. Over
  70,000 additional students enroll in the college in the fall of 1970,
  doubling CUNY enrollments in a matter of years.

## Bitter Irony in Comparing City College to Jim Crow South

- In a report to a special State legislative committee, Lester Granger,
  the former director of the Urban League, concluded that the evidence of
  racial disparities in the municipal colleges revealed a "bitterly
  ironic" comparison between local conditions to Jim Crow South. 
- Though the Black population of New York City was approximately the same
  as it was in all of Louisiana, Granger found that the senior colleges of
  the municipal system enrolled only 1,000 Black students whereas
  Louisiana's state colleges enrolled more than 10,000. City College was
  no good for "a racial group or one of its members against whom college
  entrance doors are barred." 

## Segregated public higher education

- The doors to the tuition-free municipal colleges remained closed to
  Black students educated in a segregated public education system. Of the
  two types of public high schools--academic and vocational--only students
  attending academic high schools could graduate with the necessary
  requirements to be admitted to City College. In 1967, only 3.7 percent
  of the academic diplomas went to Black high school graduates.
- Given the realities of segregated public education, Granger proposed
  admissions be based on student rankings within their high school, rather
  than in competition with all of the city's high school graduates.
  Granger called for leveling the playing field for students educated in
  an unequal, segregated public education system.
- One of the most vocal and political influential advocates of the
  college's high admission requirements was the Alumni Association. In its
  statement following the Granger report, it effectively called the
  proposal racist since it implies that Black and Puerto Rican students
  are incapable of competing on an equal level with their white
  counterparts. In fact, for City College students and alumni, the
  century-old free tuition policy was a tuition-free scholarship for the
  most deserving. It was not "a matter of charity" for them.
