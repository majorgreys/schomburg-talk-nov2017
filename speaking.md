From its founding in the 19th century, City College has been associated with
an egalitarian and democratic mission. That mission was best reflected in its
reputation as the "Harvard of the Poor". And, central to that mission was the
fact that New York City's municipal colleges had maintained a policy of free
tuition for over 150 years until the fiscal crisis that crippled the city in
the 1970s. However, for fifty years before the policy was finally terminated,
City College enrolled a growing number of tuition-paying students. As
tuition-free education became a privilege for the few, admission requirements
become more selective. Therefore, by the 1960s, the "Harvard of the Poor" had
become more myth than mission. 

This myth took on a racial dimension because of the shifts in the city's
demographics after the Second World War. As a million white residents
migrated out and as many black Southerners along with Puerto Ricans migrated
in, the city's public schools were transformed. But the admission policies of
the municipal colleges effectively excluded these two social groups. In the
context of sharpening racial conflict, particularly around segregated
education, the absence of black students from the City University of New York
became a cause for concern, among the social groups excluded as well as
university administrators. However, rather than countenance even minor
reforms, defenders of the status quo, both inside and outside the university,
offered the mission and ideals of City College as justification for why the
college had, and could, remain predominantly white.

# Equality of opportunity at City College

City College of New York is 170 years old today. It's predecessor, the Free
Academy, was created in 1847, by a public referendum in which 85 percent of
the city's voters approved the creation of a tax-supported public academy.
The Free Academy, as stated in the original act, was created for "**the
purpose of extending the benefits of education gratuitously to persons who
have been pupils in the common schools**." Gratuitous, in this sense, was
meant as free of charge.

The President of the Board of Education at the time, who had proposed the
Free Academy, famously proclaimed "**Open the doors to all--let the children
of the rich and the poor take their seats together, and know of no
distinction save that of industry, good conduct, and intellect**." City
College, which would be new name of the Free Academy once it began granting
bachelor degrees in 1866, was founded with the mission of equal opportunity
grounded in egalitarian and democratic ideals unique at that time. But, as
this proclamation also made explicit, this mission would only extend to those
students who could demonstrate qualification: equal opportunity, but for
only those who deserved it.

For its first fifty years, when few aspired to education past primary
education, the limits of opportunity at City College were not yet readily
apparent. But, as demand grew, admission policies increasingly focused on
individual merit in order to select only the best qualified. Based on a
narrow construction of merit as high school grades and standardized test
scores, allocating a scarce tuition-free education effectively became virtue
of the system rather than a departure from its egalitarian and democratic
mission. Fundamentally, the meritocracy that emerged in the twentieth century
was legitimated as leveling the playing field since each individual would be
admitted on their demonstrated intellectual ability rather than social
traits. While color-blind by definition, meritocracy proved a racial myth
since it was used to evade how racism continued to make the playing field far
from level.

# "Harvard of the Poor" as myth

For the children of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe at the turn of
the century, City College's admission policies and free tuition opened
opportunity otherwise closed off by the discriminatory practices of
employers and private colleges, like Columbia. For the Jewish poor, City
College was "Harvard of the Poor," in part, because of quotas at Harvard.
But that reputation was also a product of policy changes in the same
period that made admission to City College more selective. In 1924,
a required high school average was introduced for gaining admission to
city college. This was necessary because the number of city students
qualified for and seeking admission to City College had increased. 

Though begun as tuition-free, there had never been adequate tax money to
provide enough of it for the city's public colleges. Increasing grade
requirements at City College effectively rationed free higher education.
As admission requirements continued to climb, the rationing that had
originally been an unfortunate necessity because of business opposition to
taxes, became a virtue of the municipal college system. Free public higher
education, though by law a universal public good, became a tuition-free
scholarships for the most deserving in the context of scarcity.

By 1961, when the loosely-coordinated four municipal colleges were
consolidated into one citywide system, the City University of New York
(CUNY), City College was no longer for the city's poor. Admission
requirements had risen throughout the 1950s and would continue to as the
children of the postwar baby boom graduated high school. In a special New
York Times feature on the municipal system published in 1965, David
Boroff, a graduate of Brooklyn College, noted that "the students
themselves have unquestionably changed"; they were no longer "the children
of pants pressers and pushcart peddlers." Instead, the students at CUNY
were increasingly viewed as an academically elite whose families could
afford to pay tuition. 

Rising admission requirements in the postwar period effectively excluded
the city's black students who were, more than ever, trapped in inferior
segregated schools. For them, the myth City College as educating the
city's poor became part the liberal racism in New York City that justified
racial inequality at home.

# A liberalism which is truly liberal

![Martin Luther King Jr. speaking at City College commencement, June 1963](assets/images/king-speech-1963.jpg)

It is against this backdrop, we turn our attention to a speech that Martin
Luther King Jr. gave at City College on June 12, 1963. An estimated 15,000
people were gathered that day for commencement ceremonies. Even with such a
large audience, King had not yet gained the prominence as a national leader he
would after the March on Washington later that summer. In fact, the *New York
Times* only briefly remarked on the special speaker at commencement and no
mention of his speech made it into the page of the *Amsterdam News.*

King's appearance came at a critical juncture in the Southern civil rights
struggle. The invitation to speak at commencement the previous month had
arrived when King was helping lead the desegregation campaign in
Birmingham, Alabama. The night before commencement, President John F.
Kennedy had delivered a speech on live television to introduce federal
civil rights legislation. Indeed, Kennedy had begun the speech by
addressing threats of violence following federal desegregation efforts at
the University of Alabama. And, tragically, on the morning of commencement
day, Medgar Evers, the NAACP field secretary in Mississippi, was
assassinated in front of his home. In his speech to City College graduates
later that day, King captured the turbulence of the moment by contrasting
the "sunlight of reason" expressed in Kennedy's speech to the
"sullen cloud" of the murder of Medger Evers.

Though attention was directed southward, racial injustice was certainly
not a problem unique to the South for King. He had already spoken of
a "pressing need" for "a liberalism in the North which is truly liberal,
a liberalism that firmly believes in integration in its own community as
well as in the deep South." King echoed that message at commencement when
he called upon the graduates to "see that the de facto segregation of the
north is as injurious to the Negro student as the legal segregation of the
south." Though King did not mention it directly, his appeal to
a predominantly white graduating class highlighted the absence of Black
graduates at commencement. In the City College 1963 yearbook, fewer than
36 black graduates appear among the 2,800 bachelor degrees granted, or
less than 2 percent. While the *New York Times* was quick to note the
number of graduates was the highest it had been since 1950, it failed to
mention that the total number of Black graduates had not changed over the
intervening fifteen years.

![Martin Luther King Jr. and Buell Gallagher](assets/images/king-gallagher-1963.jpg)

King at commencement, in traditional academic dress, foreshadows his words
two years later, after a summer of urban rebellions, when he admonished
Northern liberals:

> Many of them sat on platforms with all the imposing regalia of office to
> welcome me to their cities, and showered praise on the heroism of Southern
> Negroes. Yet when the issues were joined concerning local conditions only the
> language was polite; the rejection was firm and unequivocal.

The City College President Buell Gallagher, pictured above alongside King,
was very much the Northern liberal that King had in mind. Before City
College, Gallagher had been the president a historically black private
college in Alabama. He had also been elected to the board of directors of
the NAACP in 1943 and served on the that board for 30 years. Gallagher's
self-satisfied smile in this photograph from commencement belies the
limits of his own liberalism as well as that of City College. At the 1963
commencement, the college welcomed a Southern civil rights leader even as
it could turned away most of the black students educated down the hill in
Harlem. Gallagher rallied the audience to the cause of civil rights but
also applauded a predominantly white graduating class in a city that had
close a million black residents. 

# The meritocratic immunity of racial liberalism

![Offices of the Board of Higher Education](assets/images/bhe.jpg)

The meritocratic ideals at the heart of City College immunized Gallagher
and university administrators to charges of racial discrimination. When
charges of discrimination were leveled, as they would be throughout the
1960s, administrators and policy makers could always point to how
meritocratic admissions requirements were, in fact, race neutral. But,
being blind to the race of the student, meritocracy served to justify
racial inequality.

In 1959, the Board of Higher Education, the local governing body of the
municipal colleges, convened a special committee to propose policies for
the municipal college system. Aware of the demographic changes in the
city's public school, the committee concluded that fewer of the city's
high school graduates students would be able to meet the high admission
requirements of the public colleges. But rather than countenance even
minor reforms, the committee warned against lowering admission
requirements since it would only lead to a greater number of students
vying for seats in already crowded classrooms. Instead, the committee's
recommendation to the Board was to keep admission requirements higher
for the few tuition-free seats in the day session and to add
tuition-charging seats in the less selective evening sessions and
community colleges.

We know the full extent of their exclusion from tuition-free CUNY only
because of a federal decree that forced CUNY administration to conduct its
first demographic survey in 1967. The findings were especially damning.
Black students were only 3.6 percent of the total matriculated enrollment
at the more selective four-year colleges. Black students were more likely
to be enrolled in the less selective two-year community colleges, where
they accounted for 13 percent. Most significantly, 60 percent of all Black
students enrolled at CUNY were never admitted under existing admission
requirements and were instead paying tuition as non-matriculants.

Therefore, the growing stratification within CUNY reinforced the exclusion
experienced by most of the city's black students. Indeed, the structure of
racial inequality imposed a double penalty on black students. High
admission requirements meant that nearly all black students educated in
the city's segregated schools were excluded from the benefits of a social
provision their families paid taxes towards. Furthermore, those few black
students that did enroll, more often than not paid tuition. Black students
thus disproportionately bore the additional burden of financing
tuition-free education from which they had been excluded.

# The enduring legacy of racial liberalism

![Students at anti-tuition rally, 1976](assets/images/ccny-protest-1976.jpg)

Rather than redress its growing racial problem, CUNY doubled down on
the meritocratic ideals that had created racial disparities. Indeed, the
endurance of racial inequality at CUNY over the course of the decade is
the context for student protests led by black and Puerto Rican across the
CUNY campuses in 1969. When several hundred students occupied the South
Campus of City College on April 21, 1969, they precipitated a political
crisis that finally lowered admissions requirements and opened admissions
to CUNY to all of the city's high school graduates. The Open Admissions
policy quickly transformed the municipal system, increasing freshmen
enrollments by 75 percent in one year.

The failure of earlier efforts to reform CUNY's admissions reveals how its
liberal ideals were a barrier to racial equality. In December 1963, at
a meeting of the City College faculty union, a recently appointed member
of the Board of Higher Education, the Black trade unionist Benjamin F.
McLaurin, called for reforming CUNY's admissions to increase the number of
Black students. He proposed that five to ten percent of the freshman class
every year be admitted not based on high school grades. Instead, these
students would be nominated by their high school principals for admission
to the municipal colleges even though they had not met minimum grade
requirements for admission. Though color-blind by definition, McLaurin
hoped that the city's racial and ethnic minorities would
disproportionately benefit from the policy.

Even a reform that left much of the meritocratic system intact, such as
the one McLaurin had proposed, was quickly shot down as a form of racial
preference. In a letter published in the *New York Times*, the chairman of
the Board of Higher Education evaded the racial problem entirely by
denying the problem even existed. He retorted that CUNY, in fact, had the
largest percentage of Black and Puerto Rican undergraduates of any
university in the country. In another letter published in the *Times*
a few days later, a Hunter College student went so far as to criticize the
premise of McLaurin's proposal: "That City College is situated in
a Negro area does not entitle Negroes to admission any more than the
location of Cooper Union in the Bowery entitles derelicts to admission."

These responses illustrate the limits of racial equality under the
existing system. A 1964 report to the State senate had concluded that
a comparison of CUNY to the Jim Crow South was "bitterly ironic." Though
the Black population of New York City was approximately the same as it was
in all of Louisiana, the report estimated the more selective, tuition-free
senior colleges enrolled only 1,000 Black students whereas Louisiana's
state colleges enrolled more than 10,000. "New York City's education is
infinitely better," the report admitted, "but of what good is a superior
education to a racial group or one of its members against whom college
entrance doors are barred."

In a 1968 essay, Addison Gayle, a City College instructor and noted critic on
black literature, wrote it was "criminal that a college so close, a college
originally designed for poor people, has not opened its doors to them". Those
doors finally opened once black and Puerto Rican students occupied City College
in April 1969. During their occupation, these students shed the myth of City
College as the "Harvard of the Poor" when they renamed it "The University
of Harlem."

The meritocratic ideal lives on, even though tuition-free CUNY has long past,
and remains a barrier for achieving equality in our racially segregated
educational system.
