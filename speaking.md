Good evening! Before I begin, I want to thank Jeanne Theoharis and Komozi
Woodard for inviting me to tonight's conversation. They have been generous
mentors to me over the past three years.

My talk tonight addresses the the City University of New York in the 1960s.
I will focus primarily on City College of New York, the oldest of the four-year
municipal colleges and only a short walk from the Schomburg Library, where we
are gathered tonight. I believe the case of City College and CUNY helps us
grapple with one of the enduring legacies of Northern liberal racism, that of
racial inequality in higher education.

Many New Yorkers today might know City College as the "Harvard of the Poor."
Certainly, this image has loomed large in its 170 years of existence. Unlike
the elitist and aristocratic Harvard, City College has from its beginning been
associated with egalitarian and democratic ideals since it was tuition-free
until it the policy was terminated during the city's fiscal crisis in the
mid-1970s. However, this was only partly true. For fifty years before it was
terminated, City College and the other municipal colleges--Hunter, Brooklyn,
and Queens--enrolled a growing number of tuition-paying students in its less
selective evening sessions. Thus, the image of "Harvard of the Poor" was more
myth and mission, hidden behind a tuition-free policy we can uncover a complex
system of tuition charged to the students unable to gain admission under
existing requirements. Indeed, admissions at City College prior to 1969 was as
selective as those at Harvard or Columbia. Put simply: If you did not qualify
for admissions based on your high school grades or standardized test scores,
then you did not deserve a tax-supported tuition-free scholarship. 

Tonight, I want to address how this image served as a racial myth in postwar
New York. During the 1960s, as racial conflict sharpened here as elsewhere, in
particular around education inequalities, the meritocratic and liberal
democratic ideals embodied in the image of "Harvard of the Poor" was used by
policy makers and advocates of the status quo to justify why the college had
and could remain predominantly white. 
  
# Founded on Equality of Opportunity

City College of New York is 170 years old today. It's predecessor, the Free
Academy, was created in 1847, by a public referendum in which 85 percent of the
city's voters approved the creation of a tax-supported public academy. The Free
Academy, as stated in the original act, would be for "**the purpose of
extending the benefits of education gratuitously to persons who have been
pupils in the common schools**." Gratuitous was meant in the sense that it would
be free of charge.

The President of the Board of Education at the time, who had proposed the Free
Academy, famously proclaimed "**Open the doors to all--let the children of the
rich and the poor take their seats together, and know of no distinction save
that of industry, good conduct, and intellect**." In effect, City College,
which would be the name given to the new academy in 1866 once it began granting
bachelor degrees, was founded with the mission of equal opportunity. But, as
this proclamation makes explicit, that mission would only extend to those
students who could demonstrate certain traits, marking everyone else who did
not qualify under this criteria as undeserving. For its first fifty years, when
few aspired to higher education, the limits of opportunity at City College were
not yet apparent.

Compared to admissions based on social class or ability of a family to pay for
college education, admission to City College seemed less susceptible to certain
underlying social biases. But the ideal of meritocracy, central to the mission
of the college, was deeply problematic. The meritocratic ideal assumed the
college could narrowly define the "intellect" of individual students, initially
based on entrance exams and later on high school grades. Based on a narrow
construction of merit, the benefits of tuition-free education were bestowed
upon those deemed deserving. Fundamentally, the ideal of meritocracy in
admissions assumed a level playing field, where each individual has the same
chance of success. But racism makes the playing field far from level

# "Harvard of the Poor" as Myth

The nickname "Harvard of the Poor" has been long associated with City College.
The image **originated from policy changes starting in the 1920s**. In 1924,
a required high school average was introduced for gaining admission to city
college. This was necessary because the number of city students qualified for
admission to City College and seeking higher education had increased.
Especially for the children of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who
arrived at the turn of the century, City College's meritocratic admission
policies opened opportunity otherwise closed off by the discriminatory
practices of employers and private colleges, like Columbia.

**Though begun as tuition-free, there was never adequate tax money to provide
enough of it for the city's public colleges**. Increasing grade requirements at
City College effectively **rationed free higher education.** As admission
requirements continued to climb, the rationing that had originally been an
unfortunate necessity because of business opposition to tax increases, became
a virtue of the college. In effect, the free public higher education in New
York City was transformed from a universal public good into tuition-free
scholarships for the most deserving. 

In 1961, the loosely-coordinated four municipal colleges were consolidated into
one citywide system, the City University of New York (CUNY). By then, though,
these colleges were no longer for the city's poor. In a special New York Times
feature on CUNY published in 1965, David Boroff, a graduate of Brooklyn
College, noted that "the students themselves have unquestionably changed." They
were no longer "**the children of pants pressers and pushcart peddlers**."
Instead, the students at CUNY had come to be viewed as an academically elite
whose families could afford to pay tuition. Indeed, admission requirements had
been rising throughout the 1950s and would continue to do so in the 1960s,
hittting record levels as the children of the postwar baby boom graduated high
school. 

One of the main victims of rising admission requirements in the postwar period
were the city's Black population who were, more than ever, trapped in inferior
segregated schools. As nearly a million white residents left New York City
after the Second World War, an equal number of black Southerners and Puerto
Ricans migrated to the city, looking for jobs and educational opportunity. Yet,
while these two groups grew to half of the city's public school population,
they accounted for less than 5 percent of the tuition-free students at City
College.

# A liberalism which is truly liberal

![Martin Luther King Jr. speaking at City College commencement, June 1963](assets/images/king-speech-1963.jpg)


- It is against this backdrop that I want to talk about **Martin Luther
  King Jr. at City College on June 12, 1963**. An estimated 15,000 people
  were gathered that day at for commencement. King's appearance came at
  a **critical juncture in the Southern movement**. He had received the
  invitation to speak in early May during the Birmingham campaign. When
  Birmingham police met a march of school children with attack dogs and
  fire hoses, the photographs printed in national newspapers had shown
  disturbed many across the nation and, finally, pushed the White House to
  intervene. The night before commencement, President John F. Kennedy had
  delivered a speech on live television to introduce federal civil rights
  legislation. Indeed, Kennedy had began the speech by threats of violence
  following federal desegregation efforts at the University of Alabama.
  And, tragically, on the morning of commencement day, Medgar Evers, the
  NAACP field secretary in Mississippi, was murdered in front of his home.
  In his speech to City College graduates later that day, King captured
  the turbulence of the moment by contrasting the "sunlight of reason"
  expressed in Kennedy's speech to the "sullen cloud" of the murder of
  a leading civil rights activist.
- Certainly, for King, racial injustice was not a problem unique to the
  South. Three years earlier, King had remarked to an audience in New York
  that "there is a pressing need for **a liberalism in the North which is
  truly liberal**, a liberalism that firmly believes in integration in its
  own community as well as in the deep South." At the 1963 commencement,
  King called upon the graduates to "see that the **de facto segregation
  of the north is as injurious to the Negro student as the legal
  segregation of the south**." 
- Whereas the attention of those gathered at City College was directed
  South, the absence of Black graduates at commencement tells us much
  about Northern liberal version of Jim Crow. If you go through the
  yearbook of that year, you'll find less than 36 black graduates among
  the 2,800 bachelor degrees, or less than 2 percent. Though the *New York
  Times* was quick to note the number of graduates was the highest it had
  been since 1950, it failed to mention that the total number of Black
  graduates had not changed over the intervening fifteen years. 

# The self-satifying liberalism of City College

![Martin Luther King Jr. and Buell Gallagher](assets/images/king-gallagher-1963.jpg)\


- The image of King in traditional academic regalia foreshadows his words
  two years later, after a summer of urban rebellions, when he admonished
  Northern liberals with whom he had "sat on platforms with all the
  imposing regalia of office," showering Southern blacks with praise of
  heroism, yet "when the issues were joined concerning local condition
  only the language was polite; the rejection was firm and unequivocal." 
- But when King appeared at City College, he had not yet gained the
  prominence as a national leader he would after the March on Washington
  later that summer. In fact, the *New York Times* only briefly remarked
  on the special speaker at commencement and no mention of King's visit to
  City College made it into the page of the *Amsterdam News.*
- The City College President Buell Gallagher, pictured here with King, had
  extended the invitation to the Southern leader. Gallagher was the
  **protypical Northern liberal**. Before City College, Gallagher, a white
  man from New Jersey, had been the president of Talledega College,
  a historically black private college in Alabama. His book, *American
  Caste and the Negro College* published in 1938, had won praise from W.
  E. B. Du Bois. In 1943, Gallagher was elected to the board of directors
  of the NAACP, a position he would resign from nearly 30 years later. 
- Gallagher's self-satisifed smile in this picture belies the limits of
  City College version of Northern liberalism. The college welcomed
  a Southern civil rights leader even as it could show little progress for
  racial justice within its own halls. They did so even as they applauded
  a predominantly white graduates in a city of close a million black
  residents. University administrators were immunized from charges of
  racial discrimination because they could always point to the unbiased,
  color-blind meritocratic admissions requirements. Being blind to the
  race of the student, the liberal meritocratic ideal at City College
  served to justify the racial inequality when it did occur.  

# Meritocratic immunity and the structure of racial inequality

![Offices of the Board of Higher Education](assets/images/bhe.jpg)\


- Instead of redressing its growing racial problem, City College **doubled
  down on the meritocratic ideals** that had created those disparities.
  The endurance of a racial inequality at City College over the course of
  the decade is the backdrop to the Open Admissions struggle of 1969,
  where Black and Puerto Rican students protested across the CUNY campuses
  and percipited a political crisis that finally lowered admissions
  requirements. Because of the Open Admissions policy, freshman
  enrollments increased by 75 percent in one year. However, earlier in the
  decade, a special committee convened by the Board of Higher Education,
  the local governing body of the municipal colleges, to review the system
  concluded that demographic changes in the city's public school would
  mean fewer high school graduates would able to meet their high admission
  requirements. Rather than contenance a restructuring of opportunity, it
  warned against lowering admission requirements since that would only
  cause students to vie for seats in already crowded classrooms. The
  committee recommended keeping admission requirements **higher
  requirements for the few tuition-free seats** for full-time students in
  the day session while adding less-selective tuition-charging seats for
  those enrolled as part-time students in the evening session or in the
  community colleges. 
- Part of the problem, at the time as well as for us revisiting this
  history, is that reliable data on black students at CUNY did not exist
  until a federal decree forced CUNY administration in 1967 to conduct
  a demographic survey of its students. The findings were damning. Black
  students at the four-year senior colleges--City College, Hunter College,
  Brooklyn College and Queens College--accounted for only 3.6 percent of
  the matriculated enrollment. They were more likely to be enrolled in the
  less selective two-year community colleges, where they accounted for 13
  percent, but more significantly 60 percent of all Black students at CUNY
  were never admitted under existing meritocratic requirements but instead
  enrolled as tuition-paying non-matriculants. For most of the Black
  students who entered through the doors of the City University before
  Open Admission, there was a price for entry. 
- The structure of racial inequality imposed **a double penalty** on black
  students. High admission requirements meant that black students educated
  in segregated public schools were excluded from the benefits of a social
  provision they, at least in part, financed by paying taxes. Furthermore,
  those few black students that attend CUNY, did so as tuition-paying
  non-matriculants, thus disproportionately bearing the burden of
  financing the expansion of the very "universal" social provision from
  which they were being excluded.
- In a report to a State senate committee, Lester Granger, the former
  director of the Urban League, concluded that the evidence of racial
  disparities in the municipal colleges revealed a "bitterly ironic"
  comparison between local conditions to Jim Crow South. Though the Black
  population of New York City was approximately the same as it was in all
  of Louisiana, Granger found that the senior colleges of the municipal
  system enrolled only 1,000 Black students whereas Louisiana's state
  colleges enrolled more than 10,000. City College was no good for "a
  racial group or one of its members against whom college entrance doors
  are barred." 

# Segregated tuition-free education in the Promised Land

- In December 1963, at a meeting of the City College faculty union,
  a recently appointed member of the Board of Higher Education, the Black
  trade unionist Benjamic F. McLaurin, called for reforming admissions to
  increase the number of Black students. He proposed that five to ten
  percent of the freshman class every year be admitted "not on the basis
  of average but of potential." Such students would be nominated by high
  school principals for admission to the municipal colleges even though
  they had not met admission requirements. Though color-blind in its
  definition, McLaurin hoped that the city's racial and ethnic minorities
  would disproportionately benefit from the policy. Yet, even such
  a reform that was still committed to meritocratic ideals was quickly
  shot down. The chairman of the Board of Higher Education evaded the
  racial problem entirely by swiftly denying that existence of the problem
  to begin with. He retorted that CUNY, in fact, had the largest
  percentage of Black and Puerto Rican undergraduates of any university in
  the country. A Hunter College student even went so far as to criticize
  the basic intention of McLaurin's proposal in a letter to the *Times*:
  "**City College is situated in a Negro area does not entitle Negroes to
  admission**." 
- What did it mean for City College to remain predominantly white when it
  was in fact adjacent to black Harlem? For Addison Gayle, a leading
  literary critic and one of the few black graduates from City College in
  1965, wrote in 1968 that it was "**criminal that a college so close,
  a college originally designed for poor people, has not opened its doors
  to them**".
